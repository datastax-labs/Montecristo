# Montecristo History

Montecristo was originally created as an internal project in The Last Pickle, who were acquired by Datastax in 2020.

Datastax Professional Services adopted and further significantly enhanced the project into the codebase that is published.

When releasing the internal project to be a public one, we chose to not transfer the git history, which includes the list of contributors, but we wished to acknowledge them within the repository.
