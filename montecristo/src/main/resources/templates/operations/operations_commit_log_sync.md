## Commit Log Sync Warnings

When the commit log is operating in the default `periodic` mode, the commit log is synchronized to disk based on the `commitlog_sync_period_in_ms`, which is by default 10 seconds. (10000 ms).

When a system is under stress, particularly I/O stress the commit log synchronization can fall behind which results in warning log messages such as:

````
WARN  [PERIODIC-COMMIT-LOG-SYNCER] 2020-11-02 11:20:24,835 NoSpamLogger.java:94 - Out of 72 commit log syncs over the past 76.78s with average duration of 206.57ms, 2 have exceeded the configured commit interval by an average of 966.04ms
````

If the number of warnings is relatively low then this is not a direct cause for concern - if the number of warnings seen is elevated and there is evidence of dropped mutations, then this would be indicative of an overloaded node, or a node with an I/O subsystem under considerable stress.
